## About the Emoji Search Application
As a result of the Term 3 Hackathon, hosted by Coder Academy, our Emoji Search Application was born. The Application is a group collaboration to put our React and JavaScript skills to practice. There are existing Emoji Search Applications online, but not one that is easy to use and visually pleasing.  

**Feature 1:**
Allows you to search for the perfect emoji.  The search bar is intuitive and search results as you type.  

**Feature 2:**
Copying the emoji you want from the search results is easy.  Just click on the Emoji and it will copy to your clipboard.

**Feature 3:**
Light and Dark Mode toggle allows you to switch the application to match your mood or preference

**Feature 4:**
'Hire Us' button on the top right corner will take you to the Hire Us Page.  This page will provide you our details to get in touch.
